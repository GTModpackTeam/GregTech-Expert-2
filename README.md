## About

This ModPack is designed to be a continuation of [GregTech Expert](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/gregtech-expert), and uses [CE Unofficial](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gregtech-ce-unofficial) version of GregTech instead of the outdated CE version.
We have the concept of forcing the usage of GregTech's machines as much as possible, so we gregified most of recipes from other mods.

When you continue your GregTech journey, you will be eventually able to make something cannot be replaced by GregTech such as ME System!

## Unofficial build mods

* [Chisel-MC1.12.2-GT](https://github.com/GTModpackTeam/Chisel)

## Credited Works

* Greenhouse and some other recipes are from [GregTech-Community-Pack](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech-Community-Pack).
* Many Japanese Quests are also translated from the GCP.
* The idea of Saw Mill and some other recipes are from [IMPACT: GREGTECH EDITION](https://gtimpact.space/)
