## About
* This ModPack is designed to be a continuation of [GregTech Expert](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/gregtech-expert), and uses [CE Unofficial](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gregtech-ce-unofficial) version of GregTech instead of the outdated CE version.
* We have the concept of forcing the usage of GregTech's machines as much as possible, so we gregified most of recipes from other mods.

* When you continue your GregTech journey, you will be eventually able to make something cannot be replaced by GregTech such as ME System!

## Mod compatibility info
* GTE2 comes with compatibility scripts for the following mods. You can drop them into the mods folder and their recipes will be adjusted accordingly.
* However, support is for recipes only, so we will not respond to reports of unstable operation of the mod itself :<
    * [The Spice of Life](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-spice-of-life)
        * For those who want to live a hardcore life.
    * [Compact Machines](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/compact-machines)
        * For those who want to build a minimalist factory.
        * I think practicality starts with EV...?
    * [ME Capability Adapter](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/capability-adapter)
        * For those who want to use ME System.
    * [Volumetric Flask](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/volumetric-flask)
        * Migration to AE2 Fluid Crafting Rework. However, a Flask can still be created.
    * [ExtraCells2 - SamLam140330's Fork](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extra-cells-2-samlam140330s-fork)
        * Migration to AE Additions only. You will not be able to make any ExtraCells2 stuff.
    * More other mods support ??
        * If you want to add support for other mods, please contact us on Discord. In some cases, we will formally implement it.

## Bansoukou
* This pack uses three bansoukou patches. The first is [Chisel](https://github.com/Chisel-Team/Chisel/tree/1.12/dev), the second is [Draconic Additions](https://github.com/FoxMcloud5655/Draconic-Additions/tree/1.12.2), and the third is [EZ Storage](https://github.com/zerofall/EZStorage2).
    * [Chisel](https://github.com/GTModpackTeam/Chisel): Ore block crafting interfered with GT specifications, so it was removed.
    * [Draconic Additions](https://github.com/GTModpackTeam/Draconic-Additions): Since the recipe cannot be deleted, it was removed directly from the source.
    * [EZ Storage](https://github.com/zerofall/EZStorage2/pull/69): Captured PR that was up.

## Credits
* Many Japanese Quests are also translated from the [GregTech-Community-Pack](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech-Community-Pack).
* The idea of Saw Mill and some other recipes are from [IMPACT: GREGTECH EDITION](https://gtimpact.space/)
