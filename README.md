## About

This ModPack is made as 1.12.2 version of [GregTech Expert](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/gregtech-expert), and uses [CE Unofficial](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gregtech-ce-unofficial) version of GregTech instead of CE version.

Simple changes, but if there are recipes that can be made with GregTech's machines, I'll make the changes so that they can be made only with those.

Then, useful machines that are added by other mods will be made available for creation as they progress.
