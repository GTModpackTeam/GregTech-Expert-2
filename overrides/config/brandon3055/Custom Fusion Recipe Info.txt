//The recipe format has recently been updated! Old recipes will still work but may be disabled in a future MC version.

It is now possible to add custom fusion recipes and/or remove existing ones.
This feature is intended for Mod pack creators.

Recipes are specified using json file which you will need to place in config/brandon3055 (The same folder you should have found this text document in)
The json MUST be named "CustomFusionRecipes.json" (Without the quotes)

The following is an example of what the json file should look like (See further down for an explanation of what everything means)

[
    {
        "mode": "ADD",
        "result": "minecraft:beacon",
        "catalyst": "minecraft:nether_star",
        "energy": 1000,
        "tier": 1,
        "ingredients": [
            "minecraft:glass",
            "minecraft:glass",
            "minecraft:glass",
            "minecraft:glass",
            "minecraft:glass",
            "minecraft:obsidian"
        ]
    },
    {
        "mode": "ADD",
        "result": "minecraft:diamond_sword,1,0,{ench:[0:{lvl:5s,id:21s},1:{lvl:5s,id:20s},2:{lvl:5s,id:19s}]}",
        "catalyst": "minecraft:golden_apple,1,1",
        "energy": 1000,
        "tier": 1,
        "ingredients": [
            "ore:oreGold",
            "ore:blockGold",
            "ore:ingotGold",
            "minecraft:stone,1,0,{ench:[0:{lvl:5s,id:21s},1:{lvl:5s,id:20s},2:{lvl:5s,id:19s}]}"
        ]
    },
    {
        "mode": "REMOVE",
        "result": "draconicevolution:draconic_staff_of_power",
        "catalyst": "draconicevolution:draconic_pick",
        "ingredients": [
            "draconicevolution:draconic_ingot",
            "draconicevolution:draconic_ingot",
            "draconicevolution:draconic_ingot",
            "draconicevolution:draconic_ingot",
            "draconicevolution:draconic_ingot",
            "draconicevolution:draconic_shovel",
            "draconicevolution:draconic_sword",
            "draconicevolution:awakened_core"
        ]
    },
    {
        "mode": "REMOVE",
        "result": "draconicevolution:draconic_shovel",
        "catalyst": "draconicevolution:wyvern_shovel"
    }    
]


The above json adds 2 recipes for vanilla items and removes 2 recipes from Draconic Evolution. It should be fairly clear how those examples work
The following explains the recipes in more detail

# Adding Recipes #

"mode":
- For adding recipes mode can be set to "ADD" or it can be left out and the recipe will default to the ADD function

"result":
- This is the item stack that the recipe will create.
- This should be a specific item. It can not be an ore dictionary item.

"catalyst":
- The catalyst is the item that gets combined with the ingredients to create the result. 
- This should be a specific item. It can not be an ore dictionary item.

"energy":
- This id the energy required for the crafting. Note that this number is multiplied by the number of ingredients.
Meaning if you specifies 1000 for a recipe that has 8 ingredients the total energy cost would be 8000RF.

"tier":
- This is the crafting tier of this recipe 0 = basic, 1 = wyvern, 2 = awakened, 3 = chaotic

"ingredients":
- This is a list of ingredients required for the recipe.
- These can be ore dictionary items.


# Removing Recipes #

"mode":
- Mode must be set to "REMOVE" when removing a recipe

When removing recipes you to not need to specify the tier or energy cost of the target recipe.
You can instead just specify the result, catalyst and ingredients of the target recipe.
Optionally if you leave out the ingredients it will remove any recipe matching the result and catalyst items.


## Item Stack Strings ##

Example:      minecraft:wool,16,14     - This is 16 red wool
Ore Example:  ore:ingotCopper          - This is 1 copper ingots using the ore dictionary
Note: Ore entries do not support more that 1 stack size, Item damage or nbt
More on the ore dictionary http://www.minecraftuniversity.com/forge/ore_dictionary_list/

The name used in the item/block registry name or an ore dictionary name. Both the number of items and the damage value are optional

Examples:
name, stack size, meta, NBT
ore:stone
minecraft:stone         
minecraft:stone,64       
minecraft:stone,64,3 
minecraft:stone,64,3,{NBT}


### Notes ###
The order in which you add/remove recipes does not matter when replacing recipes. 
Meaning for example you can add a recipe for a DE item then remove the original recipe and it will not remove the one you jsut added.

You can use ore dictionary items for the catalyst and result when adding recipes but the default fusion implementation does not support that. 
So they will be replaced with the first item stack from the ore dictionary that matches that name.
