# Mod compatibility info
* GTE2 comes with compatibility scripts for the following mods. You can drop them into the mods folder and their recipes will be adjusted accordingly.
* However, support is for recipes only, so we will not respond to reports of unstable operation of the mod itself : <
    * [Compact Machines](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/compact-machines)
    * [Volumetric Flask](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/volumetric-flask)
