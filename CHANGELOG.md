## ðŸ’£ Update Warning ðŸ’£
* Make a backup of your world before updating.
    * Fluix Dust and Charged Certus Quartz Dust are now made by GT and should be used up before the update. 
    * Removed the EIO cables as there are already various GT cables.

## EnderIO rework
* EnderIO has been acquired by GT...?
    * Until now, EIO has not been strongly associated with GT, but this update reflects the atmosphere of GT more strongly.
    * In other words, EIO became GT.

## Quest plz plz plz!!
* I implemented the quest this time because I had received feedback in my DMs and on Twitter, including from the original GTE.
