# v2.0.4
## Modpack information
### v2.0.x-beta to v2.0.4
* This is the **first stable version of v2** from this version!!
* Various improvements have been made, including feedback, bug reports, and a switch to a later-developed mod.
* Also, as those of you who have installed v2 may know, a CEu version with tool rework is planned for this next GTE2 version!!

### v1 to v2
* **Those updating from v1 to v2 should be sure to make a backup before doing so.**
* In addition to switching to new mods, some mods have been removed, especially factories that used a lot of trash can mods should be stopped before the update and replaced with the new void covers that were added at CEu after the update.
    * As a supplement, we have included a script to assist in the transition of mods that have a large impact when switching to mods developed later, so please install and migrate the mods yourself. For more information, see [here](https://github.com/GTModpackTeam/gregtech-expert-2#mod-compatibility-info).
* Another major specification change is the deletion of the AE2 channel. This makes it easier to create larger networks.
* And the major change from CEu is the addition of a Cleanroom, which was in GT5u. Factories that automate wafers and chips need to replace their facilities.

## Modpack update
* The quest book has not been updated in quite some time. More quests will be added or updated in the next update!!
